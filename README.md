# ðŸŽ“ Welcome to Shir's Catan Game Simulation! ðŸš€

Get ready to embark on an exciting journey through the fascinating Catan game simulation implemented in this assignment. Here you have a README for what's to come in this project. ðŸŒŸ

---

## Overview ##

This project simulates a game of Catan, a popular board game where players collect resources, build settlements and roads, and compete to earn victory points. The simulation includes key game mechanics such as resource allocation, development card usage, and trading between players.

- `placeSettlement`: Places a settlement on the board.
- `placeRoad`: Places a road on the board.
- `allocateResources`: Allocates resources to players based on dice rolls.
- `allocateInitialResources`: Allocates initial resources to players.
- `claimAllResources`: Claims all resources of a specified type from all players.
- `addPlayer`: Adds a player to the board.

### `Catan` ###

The `Catan` class manages the overall game flow, including player turns, dice rolls, and determining the winner.

#### Key Methods:
- `ChooseStartP`: Chooses the starting player.
- `nextTurn`: Moves to the next player's turn.

- `getName`: Returns the player's name.
- `getPlayerPoints`: Returns the player's points.
- `getResource`: Retrieves the quantity of a specific resource.
- `getIsPlaying`: Returns whether the player is currently playing.
- `setIsPlaying`: Sets the playing status of the player.
- `decrementSettlements`: Decreases the player's settlement count.
- `getSettlementCount`: Returns the player's settlement count.
- `getRoadCount`: Returns the player's road count.
- `incrementKnightCount`: Increases the player's knight count.
- `randomResource`: Chooses a random resource from the player's resources.
- `removeResource`: Removes a specific amount of a resource from the player.
- `decrementRoads`: Decreases the player's road count.
- `addDevelopmentCard`: Adds a development card to the player's collection.
- `getDevelopmentCards`: Returns the player's development cards.
- `getKnightCount`: Returns the player's knight count.
- `incrementSettlment`: Increases the player's settlement count.
- `incrementRoad`: Increases the player's road count.
- `chooseResourceToClaim`: Prompts the player to choose a resource to claim.
- `chooseResource`: Prompts the player to choose a resource.
- `chooseRoadLocation`: Prompts the player to choose a location for a road.

### `Card` ###

The `Card` class and its derived classes represent different types of development cards (Knight, Progress, VictoryPoint) and their effects.

#### Key Classes:
- `Card`: Base class for all cards.
- `VictoryPointCard`: Represents a victory point card.

## Testing ##

The project includes a comprehensive set of tests using the `doctest` framework. The tests cover various game scenarios, including resource allocation, development card usage, and player actions.



---

## Game Mechanics ##

### Resource Allocation ###
Resources are allocated to players based on the dice roll. Each tile produces a specific resource when its number is rolled. Settlements adjacent to the tile receive one resource, while cities receive two.

### Development Cards ###
Players can purchase development cards using specific resources. These cards provide various benefits, such as gaining extra victory points, moving the robber, or gaining resources.

### Trading ###
Players can trade resources with each other to obtain the resources they need to build roads, settlements, and cities.

### Winning the Game ###
The first player to reach 10 victory points wins the game. Points are earned by building settlements and cities, as well as by holding certain development cards.
